## IMPORTANT

## Process

1. For each task create a feature branch, then open and merge a PR to the `master` branch when the task is completed. Each completed task should have a corresponding PR. Use the following format to create a a feature branch `group-name/name-of-task-or-feature`. If you are working on `Build Login User Interface` from the `Authentication` group, your feature branch will be `authentication/build-login-user-interface`
2. Always branch out from the `main` branch
3. Publish your branch before sending a PR
4. Your branch will be deleted and merged once it passes all tests and checks by your reviewer


## Tasks

There are groups of tasks for this project. Inside the groups the tasks are ordered in the manner in which they are supposed to be implemented and the ordering of the groups is in order of importance.

It’s okay to change UI design and behavior if you have good input, as long as you communicate the changes. 
It’s great to add something that’s not on the list if it does not cost a lot of effort.

<!-- Project designs are available [in Synology](/PCES/Software Development/PCESBroker/BROKER Version 2.0/Designs) and on the sub-tickets [on JIRA](https://pcesprojects.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/B20). -->
